P(2 HEDGEHOGS WILL BE AT ONE POINT IN 3 STEPS) = P(Z)?

$$
\begin{align}
P(\text{same vertex in 1 step}) = 0 \\
P(\text{same vertex in 2 steps}) = ?  \\
\end{align}
$$
Such is only possible in $D$, and as they do 2 steps both formula can be written as:
$$
\begin{align}
P(\text{same vertex in 2 steps}) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} \cdot\left(  \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} = \frac{1}{16}  \\
\end{align}
$$
As we already understood, the only direction in which distance is even, is direction counter-clocwise for A-hedgehog, and clockwise for B-hedgehog. Therefore only possible situations are there.
