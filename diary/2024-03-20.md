Higher income increases acceptance, self-explanatory.
Higher CNT_MNTH_LAST_PMNT increases acceptance because people who payed for their last credit a long time ago probably take this more seriously and do not take loans every week. Higher age greatly increases acceptance as people of higher age generally have more money and more possibilities to take loans, they also may have great loan history. Higher job experience greatly increases acceptance, as people with a lot of job experience are more probable to continue working and not be fired, also income may be correlated with that, which we will soon find out. Months of active passport also increase acceptance a lot, most of the time people with low active passport time are foreigners that want to live in local country, but their unfixed lifestyle and shaky background may be risky for loan givers such as banks.
