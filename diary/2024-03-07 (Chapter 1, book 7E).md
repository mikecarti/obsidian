## N1
1) Collect a dataset of cross sectional data on different schools with feature of class size and target of student performance, fit linear regression, conduct p value test on significance of class size
2) negative correlation may be expected because the lesser class size, the bigger test score, as more attention is brought to each student
3) No, it could be a coincidence, and causality not determined, or this variable is a proxy

N2
1) How much does ceteris paribus hours of job training per worker influences the number of non-defective items produced per worker hour
2) No, for good workers or poorly trainable, companies would not really want to train them. Measurable - non-defective items per hour, profit per capita, non-measurable - trainability.
3) Job conditions
4) We can not state that directly, as it still may be just a coincidence
## N3
No, it does not really makes sense, i would say, that there is no direct dependence, they are dependent both on each other. 

## N4
1) I would probably need panel data
2) yes, but it is hard, it would require asking for some states to lower taxes by some amount 
3) no, as there are too much of factors and dependencies within a country
