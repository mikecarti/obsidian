# Cusp Catastrophe 
![[Pasted image 20230917091718.png]]
Given 2 [[Control Factors]] and 1 [[Behavioral Axis]]. Cusp [[Catastrophe]] resemble the [[Universal Unfolding]] of [[Singularity|Singularity]]  $f(x)=x^4$ and has the equation $F(x, u,v)= x^4+ux^2+vx$. 

$$
\frac{dY}{dt}=\frac{{dV(Y;\alpha,\beta)}}{dY}
$$
Y - true response.
$\alpha$ - normal control factor (asymmetry)
$\beta$ - splitting control factor (bifurcation, разветвление)
$V$ - [[Potential]] function of the system defined:
$$
V(x;u,v)=v x + u x^2 + x^4
$$

Giving us:
$$
\frac{d\left( v x + u x^2 + x^4 \right)}{dx} = 4x^3 + 2ux + v = 0
$$
if change in function $V$ w.r.t. $x$ go to 0, then changes in $x$ happening through time $t$ will also go to 0. (stable state)

### Notes:
- highly relevant for researchers as both a guidance and methodology to investigate phenomena with bimodal distribution and sudden jumps

#### Example:
Given a skier, hands are his control factors (variables u, v). 
Catastrophe is a transition from STANDING STILL (one stable state) to LYING ON ICE (another stable state). These states are pretty stable to outside-of-system interactions


# Behavioral Axis
Behavioral Axis in [[Catastrophe]] Theory resembles a state of a system. For example, density of biomass cells in a $cm^3$ of water. 

# Control Factors
Control Factors in [[Catastrophe Theory]] are dependent variables in a [[Catastrophe]] model. These variables help to predict the dynamic of the system (dynamic of $x$), these variables thrive in predicting fast sudden changes of $x$. 

### Normal Variable (asymmetry)
Normal variable $u$ is responsible for *when* the unexpected jump will happen.

### Splitting Variable (Bifurcation)
Splitting variable $v$ is responsible for the scale of an unexpected jump.


# Universal Unfolding
A universal unfolding describes the behavior of a system near a [[Control Factors#Splitting Variable (Bifurcation)|bifurcation]] point.

In simpler terms, universal unfolding describes the dynamic of a system when it undergoes a critical point or a major transition.

### Bifurcation sets of unfoldings
[[Control Factors#Splitting Variable (Bifurcation)|Bifurcation]] set is an associated object to unfolding. This set is existing in parameter space of some unfolding function, this set provides parameter values, for which the resulting function has [[Degenerate Singularity]]. 

# Potential function
In [[Catastrophe Theory]] a system's potential $V$ is a tendency towards some specific unexpected outcome.
