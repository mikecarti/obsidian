# Getting Familiar With Data
![[Overall Profits.png|w75]]
### Seasonality Analysis
The graph depicting overall profits revealed a distinct pattern of seasonality. Notably, profits exhibited an upward trend from the 1st quarter to the 4th quarter, suggesting fluctuations in profitability over the course of the year. This seasonal variation could be attributed to factors such as consumer behavior, market trends, or promotional activities that influence sales volumes and consequently, profits.

### Product Dynamics
A close examination of the data also shed light on the dynamics of product profitability. It became evident that certain sub-categories yielded significantly higher profits compared to others. This observation prompted a strategic approach aimed at optimizing the performance of non-profitable and low-profit domains within the business. By focusing efforts on enhancing the profitability of underperforming product categories, it is possible to bolster overall financial performance and drive sustainable growth. I will focus on this strategy for this analysis.

### Profits for Products and Clients
Analyzing profits on a density map unveiled diverse profitability trends. While some products showed positive profitability, others exhibited negative profitability, with most products demonstrating modest profitability levels. This detailed insight into product profitability aids in pinpointing areas for enhancement and implementing focused strategies to boost profits. 


# Deeper Profit Analysis.
![[Segment and Categories.png|w75]]

## Profits and Delivery Density.
The analysis reveals a noteworthy trend: low shipping costs can negatively affect profits, potentially leading to negative profitability. **This emphasizes the importance of strategic business approaches that prioritize low shipping costs only in regions, categories, and markets where profitability is guaranteed**. Aligning shipping strategies with profitability goals can help businesses avoid losses linked to excessive shipping expenditures.

## Ship Mode and Category
The analysis of ship mode and category profitability provides key insights into profit determinants. Technology emerges as the most profitable category, attributed to lower delivery costs. Conversely, office supplies, despite low shipping costs, yield modest profits. **First-class and same-day delivery options incur high shipping costs, suggesting potential for cost reduction by eliminating same-day delivery and optimizing profitability.****

## Profit by Region/Segment
The analysis of profit distribution across various regions and segments revealed that the consumer segment stands out as the most profitable. However, certain regions like Canada, LATAM, APAC, and EMEA have a relatively low presence of the corporate sector. **Therefore, reallocating resources to target other sectors within these regions could yield higher profitability and strategic benefits.**

## Profit by Region and category
The analysis of profit distribution by region and category revealed notable purchasing trends. Specifically, the Central EU sector showed a high demand for office supplies, while the North APAC region favored technology and furniture products. **Prioritizing exceptional service and quality offerings to these sectors is crucial due to their significant contribution to overall profitability. Aligning product offerings with regional preferences and market demand presents an opportunity for businesses to capitalize on and sustain growth.**


# Geographical Analysis 
![[Geography Economics 1.png]]
Upon examination, regions characterized by high shipping costs emerge as potential areas of high profitability. Examples include Mali, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uruguay, among others. The elevated shipping costs in these regions may be indicative of robust demand or logistical challenges that necessitate higher shipping expenditures. **Consequently, business should consider leveraging these regions' potential for profitability by implementing targeted marketing and distribution strategies.**

Conversely, certain regions exhibit low profitability despite moderate shipping costs. Examples of such regions include Kazakhstan, Argentina, Sweden, Zimbabwe, and Turkmenistan. This discrepancy suggests underlying factors contributing to diminished profitability, which warrant further investigation and analysis. By delving deeper into the market dynamics, competitive landscape, and consumer behavior within these regions, we can identify opportunities for optimization and growth.

In essence, the geographic analysis underscores the importance of contextualizing profitability within the broader regional dynamics. **By identifying regions with favorable profitability indicators and scrutinizing those with suboptimal performance, business can refine their strategic initiatives and maximize profitability across diverse geographic markets.**

## Non-Profitable regions
![[Non-Profitable Regions.png|w75]]
The analysis of non-profitable regions highlights operational challenges and opportunities for improvement. Identifying consistent patterns of low profitability across Consumer (C), Business (B), and Home Office (G) segments underscores the need for strategic interventions. Addressing these challenges requires a reassessment of selling strategies and product offerings, potentially involving marketing adjustments, pricing revisions, or product discontinuations in underperforming regions.

The following table outlines the markets with the highest losses across various segments:

|     | Furniture                                   | Office Supplies      | Technology            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| C   | Africa, EMEA, Central, South, Southern Asia | Africa, Central,EMEA | Africa, Central, EMEA |
| B   | Africa, EMEA, Central                       | Africa, EMEA         | Africa,  EMEA         |
| G   | Africa, EMEA, Central, North                | EMEA                 | EMEA                  |

By implementing targeted measures to address the challenges in these unprofitable markets, the company can optimize its operations and drive towards greater profitability. Through strategic restructuring and realignment of resources, the company can position itself for sustained success in the global marketplace.


## Non-profitability of Table product. 
![[Tables Profitability.png|w75]]

  
The visual analysis highlights tables as the sub-category with the highest losses, attributed to significantly higher average shipping costs compared to other sub-categories. Despite this, major markets such as the USA, China, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, India, and various European countries contribute to significant sales volumes, generating profitable outcomes for the company.

![[Pasted image 20240301220652.png|w75]]

Despite that, the examination also emphasizes the existence of unprofitable markets where table sales are minimal. Despite their small scale, these markets disproportionately affect the company's overall profitability, leading to reduced profits.

![[Pasted image 20240301221126.png|w75]]

Consequently, it is imperative to reassess the company's strategy regarding table sales in these regions. **One option is to optimize the strategy to enhance profitability by leveraging logistical efficiencies or targeting specific customer segments. Alternatively, *discontinuing* table sales in these non-profitable markets may be a prudent decision to mitigate losses.**

Furthermore, this analysis sheds light on other non-profitable products, including phones, bookcases, appliances, chairs, and copiers, which exhibit similar patterns of low profitability. Interestingly, these products also incur high shipping costs, suggesting potential synergies in addressing logistical challenges across multiple product categories.

In conclusion, the insights gleaned from the analysis underscore the importance of strategic decision-making tailored to the unique dynamics of each market. **By optimizing product offerings, refining distribution strategies, and minimizing logistical inefficiencies, business can enhance profitability and sustain growth in diverse market environments.**
