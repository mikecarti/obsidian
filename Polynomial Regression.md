The standard way to extend linear regression to settings in which the relationship between the predictors and the response is nonlinear has been to replace the standard linear model $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$ with a polynomial function $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2x_i^2 + ... + \beta_dx_i^d + \epsilon_i,$$ or $$y_i = \sum_{k=0}^d \beta_kx_i^k + \epsilon_i.$$

  

Here we vary the degree of polynomial $d$
