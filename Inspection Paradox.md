### Which bus will be more crowded? And by how much~ ?
Given all [[Poisson Distribution#Assumptions|5 Assumptions of poisson]] distribution.

Number of people in a bus is ~ proportional to wait between buses.
$$
E(T_{R}) \qquad\qquad E(T_{R+1})
$$
$R$ - random!
$\mathbb{E}(T_{1})=\mathbb{E}(T_{2})=\dots=\mathbb{E}(T_{R})$ (by the [[Poisson Distribution#Assumptions|theorem]])
