If features are colinear, if you can exchange time for quality, dont take away colinear features.
Theoretical weights ($beta$) solving. It affects interpretation of a model.
$$
\beta = (E[XX^T])^{-1}Xy
$$
In case if matrix is singular, then we may use
"Moore-Pemrose inverse"
"Pseudoinverse"

## Dealing with it
- [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]]
- [[Regularization]]
- [[Auto-Encoders]]

## Does not violate [[Gauss Markov Theorem]]
