### [[Multicollinearity]] 
If features are colinear, if you can exchange time for quality, dont take away colinear features.

Theoretical weights ($\beta$) solving
$$
\beta = (E[XX^T])^{-1}Xy
$$
In case if matrix is singular, then we may use
"Moore-Pemrose inverse"
"Pseudoinverse"

### EPE(f)
 $$EPE(f) = E \left[ L(y,f(X)) \right] = E\left[ (y − f(X))^2\right] \to \min_{f}.$$
