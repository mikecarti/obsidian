### As number of dimensions increases
- The observations are distancing from each other
- space becomes sparser
- more observations are needed to maintain the constant distancing between neighbors



Data should be compressed to low dimensions, so algorithms could capture important features and patterns. [[Embeddings]] are a one example of [[Latent Space]]
