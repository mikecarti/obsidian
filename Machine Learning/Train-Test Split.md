Is done so model could generalize.


## Train-Test-Validation Split
Validation is needed when we train A LOT of models, and then we need to recheck best of models on a validation set.

## Split Size
1) Training data must be as large as possible
2) Test data must be representative


### Split size for Train-Test-Validation
For example:
80 : 10 : 10
70 : 20 : 10
