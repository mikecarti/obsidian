2)
$b(x) \in [0,1]$
On this interval, neg. objects are distributed with $pdf(b) = 2 - 2b$
pos. objects are distributed with $pdf(b) = 2b$

ROC - formula, area under it?


$[b(x)\geq t]$
$TPR(b, t)$

then 
$y = 2\sqrt{ x } - x$
$TRP = 2\sqrt{ FRP } - FRP$
$\int_{0}^{1} (2\sqrt{ x }-x) \, dx=\frac{5}{6}$


5)$l$ = 4000 (bank clients)
enough budget to only call 800 times
data analysts derived that 6% of clients respond on this invitation
data scientists made 2 models

$\mathcal{A}$: FPR = 0.1, TPR = 0.2
$\mathcal{B}$: FPR = 0.25, TPR = 0.6

We want to call 800 clients
