## About
Neural nets is a oversimplified model of humans' brains. It consists of neurons. 
These neurons have their own trainable weights.

W<sub>i,j</sub> = Weight from neuron i<sup>[n-1]</sup> to j<sup>[n]</sup> 
x1...xm =  Inputs
b<sub>i</sub><sup>[n]</sup> = [[Bias]] for i-th neuron on n-th layer
a<sub>i</sub><sup>[n]</sup> = R(X) = R(x<sub>1</sub> * w<sub>1</sub> + ... + x<sub>m</sub> * w<sub>m</sub> + b)
R = [[Activation  functions|Activation function]]
S = [[Sigmoid]] Function
