A universal unfolding describes the behavior of a system near a [[Control Factors#Splitting Variable (Bifurcation)|bifurcation]] point.

In simpler terms, universal unfolding describes the dynamic of a system when it undergoes a critical point or a major transition.

### Bifurcation sets of unfoldings
[[Control Factors#Splitting Variable (Bifurcation)|Bifurcation]] set is an associated object to unfolding. This set is existing in parameter space of some unfolding function, this set provides parameter values, for which the resulting function has [[Degenerate Singularity]].
