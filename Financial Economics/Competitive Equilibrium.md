All agents in the economy trade competitively and the market *clears*.

### Formal definition
1. Agents maximize utilities.
$$
\max_{c_{1},c_{2},\dots c_{L}} u^h
$$
$$
c_{1}p_{1}+c_{2}p_{2}+\dots+c_{L}p_{L} \leq e_{1}^hp_{1} + e_{2}^hp_{2} + \dots + e_{L}^hp_{L}
$$
(you can't buy more than there is on a market)

2. Markets clear.
$L \text{ Equations:}$
$$c_{1}^1 + c_{1}^2 + \dots + c_{1}^H=e_{1}^1+ \dots e_{1}^H$$
$$
\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots
$$
$$
\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots\dots
$$
$$
c_{L}^1+c_{L}^2+\dots+C_{L}^H = e_{L}^1+\dots+e_{L}^H
$$

$H$ agents in the economy (1, 2 ..., H)
$L$ good in the economy

Endowments of Agents     $e_{\ell}^h$ 
(how much of good $\ell$ does agent $h$ has in the beginning)

$C_{i}$ - consumption for good $i$
Utility functions of agents $u^h (C_{1}, C_{2} \dots C_{L})$
Prices of goods      $p = (p_{1},p_{2}\dots p_{L})$
