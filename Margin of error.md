# Formula
$$
\Delta  = sd({\theta}) \cdot  t
$$
where $sd_{\theta}$ is a [[Standard Error]]  of [[Estimators|estimator]] ($\theta$) and $t$ is the [[Confidence Level]].

# Definition
Margin of error is a statistical value, that defines, by how much an [[Estimators|estimator]] value could differ (maximum) from a value out of [[Population]] given some probability.


# Example
the average height of a first-year student is 180 ± 20 cm with a probability of 95%

Here:
180 cm - the [[Sample Mean]];
95% - confidence level;
160-200 cm - [[Confidence Interval]];
20 cm - [[Margin of error]] .
