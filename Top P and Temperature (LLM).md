- Temperature is a parameter that controls the “creativity” or randomness of the text generated by GPT-3. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.7) results in more diverse and creative output, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) makes the output more deterministic and focused.
- In practice, temperature affects the probability distribution over the possible tokens at each step of the generation process. A temperature of 0 would make the model completely deterministic, always choosing the most likely token.

Next, let’s discuss top_p sampling (also known as nucleus sampling):

- Top_p sampling is an alternative to temperature sampling. Instead of considering all possible tokens, GPT-3 considers only a subset of tokens (the nucleus) whose cumulative probability mass adds up to a certain threshold (top_p).
- For example, if top_p is set to 0.1, GPT-3 will consider only the tokens that make up the top 10% of the probability mass for the next token. This allows for dynamic vocabulary selection based on context.
