The cross product is defined by the formula[8][9]
$$
 {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} =\|\mathbf {a} \|\|\mathbf {b} \|\sin(\theta )\,\mathbf {n} }
$$
where

θ is the angle between a and b in the plane containing them (hence, it is between 0° and 180°),$‖a‖$ and $‖b‖$ are the magnitudes of vectors a and b, n is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing a and b, with direction such that the ordered set (a, b, n) is positively oriented.
