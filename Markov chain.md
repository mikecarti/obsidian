Applicable when there is no memory (correlation) in a process

# Markov Assumption 
is that when you are at a some point trajectory forward is not in any way dependent on path that were taken to get here.

Example: 
If Apple's share worth 100$, You should make a decision solely based on that it is worth 100\$ at that point.
