## Definition
Formally, a [[Latent Space]] is defined as an abstract multi-dimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events. 

## Importance in [[Deep Learning]]
Data should be compressed to low dimensions, so algorithms could capture important features and patterns. [[Embeddings]] are a one example of [[Latent Space]]
