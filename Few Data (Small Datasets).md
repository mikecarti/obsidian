Problem: For small datasets, data can vary significantly depending on the [[Train-Test Split]], then we can say that [[Loss Function|loss]] will have a high [[Variance]].
Solution: [[K-Fold Cross Validation]]

### [[Deep Learning]] 
When little training data is available, itâ€™s preferable to use a small model with few
intermediate layers (typically only one or two), in order to avoid severe [[Over-fitting]]
