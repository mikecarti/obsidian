Moment Generating Function
Definition
For many distributions, all the moments E(X), E (X2)... Can be encapsulated in a single
function, which is called 
moment generation function. It exists for many commonly used
distributions and often provides 
the most efficient way to calculate moments.
:
The moment generating function of a random variable X is a function M, R → [0; ∞0)
given by:
Σetx fx(x)
So etx fx (x) dx
if X continuous
Where, to be well-defined, we require some h> 0 such that Mx(t) < ∞ for all te
[-h, h].
Mx(t) = E(etx) =
if X discrete,
