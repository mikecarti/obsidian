Mann-Whitney U test belongs to a family of [[Hypothesis Testing and Test Statistics|Non-Parametric Tests]]. Such tests usually do not require assumptions of some concrete probability distribution, unlike [[Hypothesis Testing and Test Statistics|Parametric Tests]] like [[T-Test]]. 
$$
\begin{align}
U = \min_{U_{1}, U_{2}} \\
U_{i} = n_{1}n_{2} + \frac{{n_{i}(n_{i}+1)}}{2} - R_{i} \\
R_{i} - \text{ sum of ranks in group } i
\end{align}
