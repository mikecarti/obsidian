Latent variables are those variables that are measured indirectly using observable variables.

So, rather than measuring things that can’t be quantified, we infer the value using variables we can quantify.

For example, there’s no unit for measuring employee dedication or user experience. But these variables are important to improving workplace culture and product value.

**<u>So they are being calculated as aggregation of other variables</u>**
