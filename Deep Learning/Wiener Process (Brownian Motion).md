A subset of [[Martingale]] class.
## Assumptions of Standard Wiener Process:
1. $W_{0}$ = 0 
2. $W$ has independent increments: for every $t > 0$, the future increments $W_{t+u}-W_{t}, u\geq 0$, are independent of the past values $W_s \quad {\displaystyle s<t.}$
this could be also said through [[Sigma-Algebras]]:
	$\mathcal{F}_{t}$ is a $\sigma$ algebra generated by $W_{s \in t}$  
 $W_{t}- W_{s}\sim N(0, t-s)$  $t \geq s$
3. $W_{t}- W_{s} \sim N(0,t-s)$


## Properties
$Cov(W_{t}, W_{s}) = E(W_{t}W_{s})$ $=s$        Where $s \leq t$
