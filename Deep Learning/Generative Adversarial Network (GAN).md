## In simple words
- Two Neural Networks are involved.
- One of the networks, the Generator, starts off with a random data distribution and tries to replicate a particular type of distribution.
- The other network, the Discriminator, through subsequent training, gets better at classifying a forged distribution from a real one.
- Both of these networks play a min-max game where one is trying to outsmart the other.
