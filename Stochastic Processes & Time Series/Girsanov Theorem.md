If: $(W_{t})$ - is a standard [[Wiener Process (Brownian Motion)|W.P.]] with respect to probability $P$. ($W_{t}-W_{s}\sim^{P} N(0;t-s)$)
$W_{t}^{*} = W_{t}+ \alpha t$

Then: we may introduce a new probability $P^{*}$ such that $(W_{t}^{*})$ is a standard [[Wiener Process (Brownian Motion)|W.P.]] with respect to $P^{*}$ .
