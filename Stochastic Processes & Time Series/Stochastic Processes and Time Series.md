## Stochastic Process
### [[Markov chain]]

Stochastic process $X_N$ is a [[Markov chain]] (MC) if 
$$
P[X_{n+1} = j | X_{n}= i, \mathbf{X_{n-1}}] = P[X_{n+1}=j|X_{n}=i]=P_{ij}
$$
(Assumes that you may predict future states by using connections between nodes and edges)
That is a probability of coming from state $i$ to state $j$ , it does not account $\mathbf{X_{n-1}}$.





### [[Monte Carlo]]
	Class of possible trajectories that may be generated by [[Monte Carlo]] is called a Stochastic Process.



### Optimal Stopping Time (Hardest question in Stochastics)
given function $t \to t+1$ give estimation of probability that in fixed time that function will touch some boundary. 

Important in [[Monte Carlo]], in [[Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)]]s, etc.
