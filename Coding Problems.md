These steps you need to follow while solving a problem:

– Understand the question, read it 2-3 times.  
– Take an estimate of the required complexity.  
– find, edge cases based on the constraints.  
– find a brute-force solution. ensure it will pass.  
– Optimize code, ensure, and repeat this step.  
– Dry-run your solution(pen& paper) on the test cases and edge cases.  
– Code it and test it with the test cases and edge cases.  
– Submit solution. Debug it and fix it, if the solution does not work.
