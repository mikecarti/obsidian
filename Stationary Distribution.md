The vector pi is called a [[Stationary Distribution]] of the chain of it has entries {pi_j \in S} such that:
a) $\pi_{j} \geq 0 \text{for all j, and} \sum_{j \in S} \pi_{j}=1$
b) it satisfies $\pi = \pi  P$, that is $\pi_{j} = \sum_{i}\pi_{i}p_{i,j}$ for all $j \in S$


$$
u(n)=u(o)P^n=\pi P^n=\pi PP^{n-1}=\pi P^{n-1}= \dots = \pi
$$

u(n) - probability distribution after n steps in [[Markov chain|MC]] 

## [[Eigenvector]]
Stationary distribution may be also viewed as an [[eigenvector]] for a [[Markov chain#Transition Matrix |Transition Matrix]] P.
