Control Factors in [[Catastrophe Theory]] are dependent variables in a [[Catastrophe]] model. These variables help to predict the dynamic of the system (dynamic of $x$), these variables thrive in predicting fast sudden changes of $x$. 

### Normal Variable (asymmetry)
Normal variable $u$ is responsible for *when* the unexpected jump will happen.

### Splitting Variable (Bifurcation)
Splitting variable $v$ is responsible for the scale of an unexpected jump.
