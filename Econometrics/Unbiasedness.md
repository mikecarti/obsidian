is an estimator that does not tend to over-estimate nor to under-estimate the population characteristic ( $bias(\hat{T})=0$ ). 

If an estimator tends to do first or the second it has some bias that may be expressed as: 
$$
bias(\hat{T}) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \hat{T} \right] - T \quad  \text{For some pop. char. } T \text{ and estimator } \hat{T}  
$$
