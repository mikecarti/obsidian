$$
\hat{y}=\hat{\beta_{0}} + \hat{\beta_{1}}x_{1} + \dots + \beta _{k}x_{k}
$$
There is another way to obtain these coefficitents (Not [[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)]])
$$
\hat{\beta_{j}}: \hat{e}^{(y)} = \hat{\beta}_{j} \cdot e^{(x_{j})}
$$
$e^{(y)}$ are residuals from the reg. of $y$ on $X$
$e^{(x_{j})}$ are residuals from the reg. of $X_{j}$ on $X_{/j}$
