Econometrics is a branch of [[Economics]] that combines [[Statistics | statistical]] methods, economic theory, and mathematical modeling to analyze economic data. 

Econometrics is about estimating models to explain how the real world works.

## Econometrics is NOT machine learning.
### Econometrics:
- Explanation and causality
- Only interpretable white-box models
- small datasets
- Scope: economics and related problems
- Research should start with theoretical considerations

### Machine Learning:
- Accuracy and prediction quality
- white and black box models
- big datasets
- Scope: any
- Research may start from data (but theoretical considerations help)


### Data Types 
- Cross-sectional Data (N objects at the same time period)
- Time series
- Panel Data (N objects all observed at T different time periods)

### Topics:
- [[Linear Regression]]
