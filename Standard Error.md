One way to view these restrictions is this: if we know n 2 2 of the residuals, we can always get the 
other two residuals by using the restrictions implied by the first order conditions in (2.60). Thus, 
there are only n 2 2 degrees of freedom in the OLS residuals, as opposed to n degrees of freedom 
in theÂ errors. It is important to understand that if we replace u^i
 with ui
 in (2.60), the restrictions would 
no longer hold
