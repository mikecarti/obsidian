Given 2 [[Control Factors]] and 1 [[Behavioral Axis]]. Cusp [[Catastrophe]] resemble the [[Universal Unfolding]] of [[Singularity|Singularity]] $f(x)=x^4$ and has the equation $F(x, u,v)= x^4+ux^2+vx$. The equation $y=x^{2/3}$ also has a cusp catastrophe.

$$
\frac{dY}{dt}=\frac{{dV(Y;\alpha,\beta)}}{dY}
$$
Y - true response.
$\alpha$ - normal control factor (asymmetry)
$\beta$ - splitting control factor (bifurcation, разветвление)
$V$ - potential function defined:
$$
V(Y;\alpha,\beta)=\alpha Y + \frac{1}{2}\beta Y^2 - \frac{1}{4}Y^4
$$

Giving us:
$$
\frac{dY}{dt} = \frac{d\left( \alpha Y + \frac{1}{2}\beta Y^2 - \frac{1}{4}Y^4 \right)}{dY}
$$
if change in function $V$ w.r.t. $Y$ go to 0, then changes in $Y$ happening through time $t$ will also go to 0. (stable state)


### Notes:
- highly relevant for researchers as both a guidance and methodology to investigate phenomena with bimodal distribution and sudden jumps

#### Example:
Given a skier, hands are his control factors (variables u, v). 
Catastrophe is a transition from STANDING STILL (one stable state) to LYING ON ICE (another stable state). These states are pretty stable to outside-of-system interactions
