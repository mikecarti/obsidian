For NP problems we have exponential time/ space [[Complexity]]. Thus they are called Non-Polynomial (NP). For P problems (Polynomial) we have polynomial complexity, for example $f(n) = n^{3} + n^{2} + 2n$. If $P=NP$ thus for all problems theoretically can be found an algorithm that solves it in polynomial time.
