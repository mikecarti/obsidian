$$
t = \frac{{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})}{\sqrt{ \frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} }}
$$
for example $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0$.
Applicable when observations are under 30 and distributions may be assumed as [[Gaussian (Normal) Distribution]].

When these assumptions can't be met, one should use [[Mann-Whitney U test]]
